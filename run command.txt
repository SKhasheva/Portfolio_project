Issue Description: Customer has created root (tenant) Management Group. But ACM doesn't show it because it contains some not supported subscriptions (Access to AAD) which have no cost. 

After discussion with PM, he advised opening bug:

[Yesterday 11:10 PM] Michael Flanakin
Please escalate. I see 2 bugs that need to be resolved:
We should add support for 110P subscriptions. They have no cost and can be ignored.
We need to return a partial response with an error when one or more subscriptions are not supported within the management group.
